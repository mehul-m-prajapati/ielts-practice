### Task 1
#### Formal greetings (the ‘Dear -------’ part)
```
In formal letters (letters to people you don’t know, or people in authority) you will usually begin with
‘Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms Smith.’
```

#### Formal endings (the ‘goodbye’ part)
In a formal letter, try to finish your letter with two things.

- First, a ‘call to action’ sentence which tells the reader politely what you want them to do.
The easiest way to do this is to write 
- ‘I look forward to + ing or + noun.’ For example:
1. ‘I look forward to receiving your confirmation/to receiving a refund/to learning of your proposal.’
Or with a noun instead of ‘+ ing’:
2. ‘I look forward to your confirmation/to a refund/to your proposal.’
- Try to use the ‘+ ing’ form if possible, because it will impress the examiner more.


1. **‘I would appreciate your reply with a confirmation/a refund/ a proposal as I have requested.’**
2. ‘Please respond as soon as possible, outlining your confirmation/your refund/ your proposal in this
matter.’
3. ‘As you will appreciate, this is an urgent matter, and I look forward to your prompt reply.’
4. ‘Thank you for your help, and I await the information requested with interest.’
- After your ‘call to action’ sentence, you only need to write ‘Kind Regards’ and your first name +
surname.
```
Kind Regards,

Mehul Prajapati
```
