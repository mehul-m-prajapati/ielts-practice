## Old Age
#### Some commentators feel that grandparents should live together with their children and grandchildren, while others say that elderly people should be encouraged to live independently. Consider the possible arguments on both sides of this debate, and reach your own conclusion.
The issue of whether grandparents should live with their extended families is a partly question of the traditions in different cultures or nationalities. 
**However**, the question of affordability also plays an inceasing part, and so this debate is rather complex, as we shall see.

**On the one hand**, those who support the idea of grandparents living with their children point to the higher level of emotional support which all family members may receive in such situations, *for example*, in times of crisis such as bereavement.
**Furthermore**, it is also true that personal security may be increased, offering protection against such problems as accidents or even robbery. 
**Finally**, it seems that extented family life will also be considerably less costly, for instance with lower food and utility bills, meaning that enjoyment of life may be higher.

**By contrast**, supporters of grandparents living independently often state that elderly people should be encouraged to be as self-reliant as possible, as this boosts their self-esteem and may guard against mental decline in old age.
**They also say**, with some merit, that many younger families these days do not have the housing space, or indeed the spare time, which is necessary to care properly for older members.
**As a last point**, it is also true that many grandparents prefer to see their grandchildren on a less frequent basis (as opposed to every day), making these visits more special and cherished for all concerned.

**Overall**, it appears to me that the stronger argument is in favour of grandparents living independently, with all the advantages of self-relaince and separate space.
This is provided that their health and finances allow them to continue living separately, without risk or the fear of isolation.

### Children / Education 
#### ‘For all children, the ability to play a musical instrument is just as important as the ability to read and write.’ How far do you agree with this suggestion? How important is it for a child to learn to play a usical instrument, in your view?
The question of which skills to prioritise for a child's early education is important for all parents and educators, and music can certainly claim to be a key possibility when deciding which abilities to teach.
**However**, I feel that playing music is actually less important than basic literacy, and I will explain the reasons here.

**Firstly**, it seems simplistic to say that music is paramount 'for all children'. Certainly, there are some children who are hightly talented or have great interest in music, and when we think of childhood prodigies such as Justin Bieber we see how this talent can be brought out.
**However**, such talents are rare, and even the enjoyment and cultural values to be gained from learning literacy is a guarantee of academic progress and the absorption of information, while playing music does not offer this security.
**For example**, it would be unimaginable to transmit scientific or mathematical information to children via the medium of music.
**Finally**, it is surely wiser to regard music as one of a wide range of secondary skills, ranking below literacy and sitting alongside sports, hobbies, foreign languages and other important but less essential activities.

**Of course**, those who say that highly talented children must be allowed to develop their talents are quite correct; it is equally true, though, that few children seem to possess musical ability to the extent that it should be prioritised so highly for all pupils.

**In conlusion**, I would not wish to underestimate the potential benefits of learning to play music for a minority of children, and it should certainly be available as an option.
**However**, if we think of all children in a given community, literacy appears to be a far stronger pathway to progress and independence.
