**You are living in a University residence, and you have a problem with the high levels of noise from a new campus restaurant which is open until midnight. Write a letter to the governor of the University. In your letter, Complain about the situation Say why this is a problem And propose ways to reduce the noise**

Dear Mr Smith,

I am writing regarding the amount of noise coming from the new canteen which has just opened near my University residence. Although I am pleased that we have this facility, the restaurant remains open up to midnight each night, and as a result there is considerable talking, shouting and the sound of motorbikes continuing until about 12.30 each night.

This causes me and my neighbors in the residence a serious problem, because at that time we are either trying to sleep, or in some cases trying to study in our bedrooms. In both cases, the noise and commotion disturbs us, making us tired in the mornings or affecting the progress of our studies. I am sure you will appreciate that this is a very worrying situation for us all.

I would like to suggest that the campus authorities restrict the canteen's opening to 11pm at the least on weekdays, leaving it at midnight during the weekend. I propose that we also put up some signs reminding users to be considerate and to keep their noise to an absolute minimum. These are simple steps which would make us all very grateful indeed.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Kind Regards,

Mehul Prajapati

**You are living in a city in a foreign country, and a friend from your home country is soon coming to visit you for several days. Write an email to your friend, asking him or her to bring some things from home which you need, saying why you need them, making arrangements to meet**

Dear Mayank,

I am so glad that you are coming to Montreal next week, as it seems ages since we last saw each other. I hope your family and girlfriend are all well. I actually have a favor to ask you, and I hope you don't mind. The fact it that I need a few things from my parents' house, and I would be so grateful if you could bring them along in your suitcase.

The first thing is the book called psychology of money which I had at high school - don't worry, it's only a small book. I need this because I want to understand the different ideas of making money, and I can't get another copy here in any of the bookshops or on the Internet. The second thing is a packets of those biscuits from the bakery in my old street. I have told everyone here how delicious they are, and my new friends are very keen to try them.

I do hope that is manageable for you, as it won't take up much space at all. In the meantime, I am very excited about seeing you again at the airport on Monday at midday. I will be in the arrivals hall, wearing my blue jacket.

I can't wait to see you then.


All the best,

Mehul

**You have received a bill from a mobile phone (or cell phone) company for international call charges relating to a time when you did not use your phone for international calls.
Write a letter to the company, complaining about this giving your reasons asking for the bill to be changed**

Dear Sir,

I have been a satisfied customer for several years, but I am writing regarding the cell phone bill I received on 17th March 2020, which includes a total $900 for international call charges. In fact, these charges are completely unjustified, for the following reason.

At no time have I used this phone to make international calls, either to my home country or to any other country. I used the phone purely for local calls and for calls to government departments in Canada, which are national calls. I have checked my call summary, there is no record of any international connections. As you see, there is no possible reason for me to be charged for international calls, and this is easily confirmed by my phone records.

I therefore request that you withdraw these charges and change my bill accordingly. I also ask you to confirm to me in wrirting that this has been actioned, by sending a copy of the revised bill to me at this address.

I look forward to receiving your confirmation that all is in order.

Kind Regards,

Mehul Prajapati

**A friend has told you that he or she feels lonely in their new city away from their family. Write to your friend, and Explain why people can feel this way.
Give some ideas on how to solve the problem. Ask your friend to contact you and tell you if this works**

Dear Meena,

I am so sorry to hear that you are feeling rather isolated in your new home, especially as you have always been such an outgoing person.

I think that people tend to feel lonely because they don't have enough opportunities to meet new friends. This leads to them staying at home more, so that the situation becomes even worse. 

If I were you, I would join some of the clubs and societies which exist at your college, for example the concordia dancing club - because I know how much you love dancing. This means you will meet people with similar interests and abilities, and you can share the enjoyment of ballroom. I would also try to use the Internet more, to meet people safely online and see if they are local to you in your new city. You have to be very careful, of course, but if you use Internet sites as they are intended I'm sure you will find some new friends - not necessarily of the romantic type !

Please do keep in touch, and let me know how you get on with these suggestions. If you let me know how this goes, I can try to think of other ways to help you in your situation at the moment.

Take care and do stay in touch,

All the best,

Mehul

**A friend who is planning to visit you has asked you to describe the most interesting and enjoyable things to do in the community where you currently live. Write an email to your friend, telling them about these things. In your email, Say what these things are Say why they are interesting/enjoyable. Suggest what you can do together**

Dear Nic,

Thanks for your email last week, and I am so happy that you are arriving next weekend.

You asked about the interesting things to do around here. Well, firstly, we have downtown area, which has many old cafes and bars, and some sights such as the statues and the colonial houses. Apart from that, there is the park, which has a theatre, more eating places, and an outdoor music venue. All in all, these places offer a lot of variety, with options for dining, sightseeing and good quality live entertainment, and all within an easy walk of the central area where I live.

Here is an idea. When you get here, let's have an early night so that you get over the jet lag, and then go to the downtown area in the morning. We can have a traditional breakfast at one of the old cafes, and see some of the sights. Then we can see a show at the theatre, have dinner in park if it's sunny, and finally listen to the music in the outdoor arena. I think we might need another early night after such a long day !

Please get in touch before the weekend just to let me know if that sounds ok, and also your flight number.


All the best,

Mehul

**You wish to apply for a new college course, but you are unsure about the details of cost, duration and subjects posted on the college website. Write an email to the relevant person in admissions at the college, asking them to clarify these points for you. In this email, Say what your interest is, Explain why the website is unclear, Request the information that you need**

Dear Mr Smith,

I am intereted in the photography course this year, and I have seen your name on the college website as the contact for admission queries. I have several questions for you, and I hope you can help.

Firstly, regarding the cost of the course, is the fee of $99 per month or for the whole year course? Is it possible to pay in monthly instalments, or is the fee paid in full up front? The website says that 'other payment methods are possible,' but there is no explanation.

Secondly, can you tell me what are the exact dates of this course? Your website says 'Summer to Autumn,' but I can't see any specific dates relating to this. I would be grateful for the precise dates, including when I need to pay for the course and buy the books and so on.

Finally, I'd appreciate some information about the course content itself, including details of the equipment to be used and the wording of the certificate I will receive at the end. The website says that I should contact you for this.

Thank you for your help, and I look forward to receiving the information requested.

Kind Regards,

Mehul Prajapati

**You recently took a plane to a holiday in a foreign city, and on arrival you found that your luggage was lost. You did not receive your luggage until the last day of your holiday. Write to the airline, complaining about this situation saying why it caused you problems, seeking suitable compensation**

Dear Mrs Smith,

As you are the head of Customer Services, I am writing regarding the loss of my baggage at Istanbul airport on April 3rd 2020. My baggage consisted of two suitcases, both being clearly labelled in the accepted way, and both being correctly locked.

On arrival at Istanbul, I found that both suitcases were listed as 'missing' and the airline staff could not give me any information about their location. This caused me substantial inconvenience, as the suitcases contained my clothing, toiletries and books, and I was obliged to buy all these items from local shops at a very high price. Even when I finally received the suitcases, I found that they were opened, and many items were missing, including clothes and personal effects. This meant that I had to replace these items at my own cost when I returned home.

I am requesting, therefore, that you kindly reimburse me the cost of $495 for all these items, and I have attached all relevant receipts. As you see, this sum does not include compensation for my inconvenience and wasted time, which I am prepared to forgo if you settle the charge promptly.

I look forward to receiving your confirmation of this payment. 

Kind regards,

Mehul Prajapati

**You are studying at a college which has very limited sports and leisure facilities for students. Write a letter to the principal. In your letter, outline the situation propose ways to improve this situation request a meeting to discuss this**

Dear Ms Smith,

I thought you might be interested in some thoughts about the amenities for sports and other free time pursuits here at the college. Although we have a table tennis room, there are no other facilities for students, and this seems a great shame as so many of us would like to socialise after study hours.

If I may suggest some improvements, I think we could adapt classroom 12 (which is rarely used) as a games room, perhaps with Wi-Fi and electical charging points. I also wonder if we could agree the use of the nearby park on certain afternoons, for team sports, yoga and running. There are quite straightforward steps which would immediately give the student body far greater scope for the leisure, with all the benefits this would bring us.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you in person, and I hope it will be acceptable if I contact your office assistant to arrange a convenient time.

Kind Regards,

Mehul Prajapati
