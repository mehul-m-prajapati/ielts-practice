**You are living in a University residence, and you have a problem with the high levels of noise from a new campus restaurant which is open until midnight. Write a letter to the governor of the University. In your letter, Complain about the situation Say why this is a problem And propose ways to reduce the noise**

Dear Mr Smith,

I am writing regarding the amount of noise coming from the new canteen which has just opened near my University residence. Although I am pleased that we have this facility, the restaurant remains open up to midnight each night, and as a result there is considerable talking, shouting and the sound of motorbikes continuing until about 12.30 each night.

This causes me and my neighbors in the residence a serious problem, because at that time we are either trying to sleep, or in some cases trying to study in our bedrooms. In both cases, the noise and commotion disturbs us, making us tired in the mornings or affecting the progress of our studies. I am sure you will appreciate that this is a very worrying situation for us all.

I would like to suggest that the campus authorities restrict the canteen's opening to 11pm at the least on weekdays, leaving it at midnight during the weekend. I propose that we also put up some signs reminding users to be considerate and to keep their noise to an absolute minimum. These are simple steps which would make us all very grateful indeed.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Kind Regards,

Mehul

Dear Mayank,

I am so glad that you are coming to Montreal next week, as it seems ages since we last saw each other. I hope your family and girlfriend are all well. I actually have a favor to ask you, and I hope you don't mind. The fact it that I need a few things from my parents' house, and I would be so grateful if you could bring them along in your suitcase.

The first thing is the book called psychology of money which I had at high school - don't worry, it's only a small book. I need this because I want to understand the different ideas of making money, and I can't get another copy here in any of the bookshops or on the Internet. The second thing is a packets of those biscuits from the bakery in my old street. I have told everyone here how delicious they are, and my new friends are very keen to try them.

I do hope that is manageable for you, as it won't take up much space at all. In the meantime, I am very excited about seeing you again at the airport on Monday at midday. I will be in the arrivals hall, wearing my blue jacket.

I can't wait to see you then.


All the best,

Mehul
