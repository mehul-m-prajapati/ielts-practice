#### The growing number of overweight people is putting strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved. Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?

Owing to the problems which a growing population of overweight people cause for the health care system, some people think that the key to solving these issues is to have more sport and exercise in schools.
I completely agree that this is the best way to tackle the issue of deteriorating public health in relation to weight.

**Firstly**, dealing with the issues surrounding obesity and weight problems is best solved by taking a long term approach and introducting more sport and exercise in schools. 
This method will ensure that the next generation will be healthier and will not have such health problems. 
**At the moment**, the average child in the West does sport possibly twice a week, which is not enough to counteract their otherwise sedentary lifestyle.
**However**, by incorporating more sports classes into the curriculum as well as encouraging extracurricular sports activities, they will undoubtebly become fitter and and more active.

**Another point to consider** is that having more sports lessons for children in schools will probably result in children developing an interest in exercise which might filter through
to other members of their family and have a longer lasting effect. **In other words**, parents with sporty children are more likely to get involved in sport as a way of encouraging their children.
By both parents and children being involved, it will ensure that children grow up to incorporate sport into their daily lives. 
This is certainly a natural and lasting way to improve public health.

**In conclusion**, to deal with an increasing population of unfit, overweight people, changing the lifestyle of the coming generation by introducing sport in schools is the easiest and most effective method to use.

#### The development of tourism contributed to English becoming the most prominent language in the world. Some people think that this will lead to English becoming the only language to be spoken globally. What are the advantages and disadvantages to having one language in the world?

**It is thought by some people that English**, which is now the most widely spoken language in the world, may one day predominate over all other languages and result in their
eventual disappearance. Having one language would certainly aid understanding and economic growth but there will also be some drawbacks.

One evident benefit to having one global language is that it would enable greater understanding between countries. 
**In other words**, if everyone spoke one language, there would be complete understanding between not only countries but all people throughout the world which would promote learning,
the flow of information and ideas. **Another reason** that one language would be advantageous is that it would help economic growth. With all people speaking the same language, there would be fewer barriers and therefore trade would flourish between countries, resulting in a healthier world economy.

**On the other hand**, ther are obvious disadvantages to having only one global language. **Firstly,** it would mean that all other languages would eventually disappear and, along with them, their cultures. The diversity of cultures is one of the joys this world has to offer. Each culture is unique with its own way of life and own perspectives of the world which would all be lost if there were only one language. **Secondly**, it would result in the collapse of tourism because there would be no reason to travel for pleasure and interest if all countries had the same language and similar cultures. This would devastate many countries economically that rely on tourism as a source of income.

In conclusion, while there are plus points to having one global language, too much would be lost as a result. Maintaining local languages and cultures should be prioritised 
to ensure a rich world heritage for future genrations.

#### Many offenders commit more crimes after serving their first punishment. Why this happens and what measures can be taken to tackle the problem?
A large number of criminals who serve their first prison sentence, leave prison only to reoffend. This is mainly because of the lack of rehabilitation and difficulty finding regular employment once released. There are a number of solutions which should be implemented to deal with criminals who reoffend.

**Firstly**, the reason for most fist-time offenders committing crimes again, once they have been released from prison, is due to lack of rehabilitation whilst in prison. 
**In other words**, offenders are not given a chance to retrain and learn new skills for their future or develop deeper understanding of correct moral behaviour and instead
mix with other criminals, which only strengthens their criminal intentions.
**Secondly**, repeat offending is also owing to the difficulty in finding employment after being released. **As a result**, many of them struggle financially which leads
them back to crime, regardless of the consequences. 

Tnere are two effective solutions to the problem of repeat offenders. One way to tackle this is to ensure that all criminals entering prison are given the chance to retrain 
with useful skills which will hopefully ensure them a job after they have served their sentence. By doing this, it will help them to reintegrate back into society and give them
some means of supporting themselves financially. **Another method of** dealing with criminals who reoffend is to have more supervision and checks in place when they are back in society. This solution would hopefully prevent them from taking any chances and deter them from reoffending because they are being so closely watched.

In conclusion, having training in prison and also close observation when first time offenders are released are effective in dealing with the issue. If governments implemented these solutions, crime figures would soon drop.

#### Some people think that money is one of the most essential factors in promoting happiness. Do you think people can be happy without much money? What factors contribute towards happiness?
Money is considered by many people to be one of the most important contributing factors towards happiness. **In my opinion**, it is possible for people to be happy even if they
have little money and other aspects of life play a more vital role in creating happiness.

Although having money brings happiness to a lot of people, it does not necessarily follow that people without money are, therefore, unhappy.
**Take for example** the comparison between developing and developed countries, most Westerners would agree that people in developing countries are happier, enjoy stronger family connections and take more pleasure in simplicities of life to a greater extent than those in developed countries.

One way that people can gain happiness is through their work. **For instance**, a doctor doing volunteer work in underdeveloped countries may have very little money but the reward of helping people and doing the job they are good at, brings happiness in itself. **In other words**, happiness can be found by using skills that people are trained
for and though job satisfaction.

**Finally**, another factor influencing happiness is having supportive and loving people in one's life. While money may bring opportunities to enjoy pleasures, few people
would enjoy them on their own. Being surrounded by a loving and caring family is considered by most people to be more valuable than any amount of money.

**In conclusion**, money is not essential for happiness, which can be found through job satisfaction as well as family. If more people strived in life towards true happiness
rather than money, the world would be a better place.

#### Many people believe that social networking sites (such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree?

Social networking sites, for instance Facebook, are thought by some to have had a detrimental effect on individual people as well as society and local communities. 
**However**, while I believe that such sites are mainly beneficial to the individual, I agree that they have had a damaging effect on local communities.

With regards to individuals, the impact that online social media has had on each individual person has clear advantages. **Firstly**, people from different countries are 
brought together through sites as Facebook whereas before the development of technology and social networking sites, people rarely had the chance to meet or communicate
with anyone outside of their immediate circle or community. **Secondly**, Facebook also has social groups which offer individuals a chance to meet and participate 
in discussions with people who share common interests.

**On the other hand**, the effect that Facebook and other social networking sites have had on societies and local communities can only be seen as negative. Rather than
individual person taking part in their local community, they are instead choosing to take more interest in people online. Consequently, the people within local communities
are no longer forming close or supportive relationships. **Furthermore**, society as a whole is becoming increasingly disjointed and fragmented as people spend more time
online with people they have never met face to face and who they are unlikely to ever meet in the future.

**To conclude**, although social networking sites have brought individuals closer together, they have not had the same effect on society or local communities.
Local communities should do more to try and involve local people in local activities in order to promote the future of community life.

#### Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing skills is more important. Discuss both sides.

It is considered by some that being a univeristy graduate is the key to securing a good job, while there are others who think that it is better to have experience and soft skills. **In my opinion**, I believe that having university education is essential for academic jobs, while soft skills and experience are more useful in business.

**On the one hand**, many think that it is easier for most people to find a good job if they are university graduates with a good degree. **In other words**, having tertiary education puts people one step ahead of others who do not and this can be a deciding factor in getting a good job. The competition to get in to universities and increasing number of graduates show just how significant this level of education is for people's future work opportunities.

**On the other hand**, having work experience and soft skills, such as leadership skills and other interpersonal skills, can throw the balance in favour of the applicant, according to some. For many positions there are an overwhelming number of applicants and, therefore, it is often thought that having relevant experience in that line of work
or having acquired useful soft skills that can be valuable to a company, can put one ahead of the game when applying for a position.

**Finally**, in my opinion, whether needing high level education or skills and experience, depends on the position being applied for. Take for example law, medicine or teaching, it is impossible to be considered for a position without required educational background. **In contrast**, in business, it would be more important for a candidate to have soft skills and experience in that line of business so they can step into a position without further training and be of immediate benefit to the company.

**In conclusion**, getting a good job requires a relevant background either in experience or education depending on the type of work and field. People should make sure they attain the necessary skills or degrees before applying for a job in order to be sure of success.
