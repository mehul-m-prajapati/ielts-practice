#### The growing number of overweight people is putting strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved. Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?

Owing to the problems which a growing population of overweight people cause for the health care system, some people think that the key to solving these issues is to have more sport and exercise in schools.
I completely agree that this is the best way to tackle the issue of deteriorating public health in relation to weight.

**Firstly**, dealing with the issues surrounding obesity and weight problems is best solved by taking a long term approach and introducting more sport and exercise in schools. 
This method will ensure that the next generation will be healthier and will not have such health problems. 
**At the moment**, the average child in the West does sport possibly twice a week, which is not enough to counteract their otherwise sedentary lifestyle.
**However**, by incorporating more sports classes into the curriculum as well as encouraging extracurricular sports activities, they will undoubtebly become fitter and and more active.

**Another point to consider** is that having more sports lessons for children in schools will probably result in children developing an interest in exercise which might filter through
to other members of their family and have a longer lasting effect. **In other words**, parents with sporty children are more likely to get involved in sport as a way of encouraging their children.
By both parents and children being involved, it will ensure that children grow up to incorporate sport into their daily lives. 
This is certainly a natural and lasting way to improve public health.

**In conclusion**, to deal with an increasing population of unfit, overweight people, changing the lifestyle of the coming generation by introducing sport in schools is the easiest and most effective method to use.

#### The development of tourism contributed to English becoming the most prominent language in the world. Some people think that this will lead to English becoming the only language to be spoken globally. What are the advantages and disadvantages to having one language in the world?

**It is thought by some people that English**, which is now the most widely spoken language in the world, may one day predominate over all other languages and result in their
eventual disappearance. Having one language would certainly aid understanding and economic growth but there will also be some drawbacks.

One evident benefit to having one global language is that it would enable greater understanding between countries. 
**In other words**, if everyone spoke one language, there would be complete understanding between not only countries but all people throughout the world which would promote learning,
the flow of information and ideas. **Another reason** that one language would be advantageous is that it would help economic growth. With all people speaking the same language, there would be fewer barriers and therefore trade would flourish between countries, resulting in a healthier world economy.

**On the other hand**, ther are obvious disadvantages to having only one global language. **Firstly,** it would mean that all other languages would eventually disappear and, along with them, their cultures. The diversity of cultures is one of the joys this world has to offer. Each culture is unique with its own way of life and own perspectives of the world which would all be lost if there were only one language. **Secondly**, it would result in the collapse of tourism because there would be no reason to travel for pleasure and interest if all countries had the same language and similar cultures. This would devastate many countries economically that rely on tourism as a source of income.

In conclusion, while there are plus points to having one global language, too much would be lost as a result. Maintaining local languages and cultures should be prioritised 
to ensure a rich world heritage for future genrations.

#### Many offenders commit more crimes after serving their first punishment. Why this happens and what measures can be taken to tackle the problem?
A large number of criminals who serve their first prison sentence, leave prison only to reoffend. This is mainly because of the lack of rehabilitation and difficulty finding regular employment once released. There are a number of solutions which should be implemented to deal with criminals who reoffend.

**Firstly**, the reason for most fist-time offenders committing crimes again, once they have been released from prison, is due to lack of rehabilitation whilst in prison. 
**In other words**, offenders are not given a chance to retrain and learn new skills for their future or develop deeper understanding of correct moral behaviour and instead
mix with other criminals, which only strengthens their criminal intentions.
**Secondly**, repeat offending is also owing to the difficulty in finding employment after being released. **As a result**, many of them struggle financially which leads
them back to crime, regardless of the consequences. 

Tnere are two effective solutions to the problem of repeat offenders. One way to tackle this is to ensure that all criminals entering prison are given the chance to retrain 
with useful skills which will hopefully ensure them a job after they have served their sentence. By doing this, it will help them to reintegrate back into society and give them
some means of supporting themselves financially. **Another method of** dealing with criminals who reoffend is to have more supervision and checks in place when they are back in society. This solution would hopefully prevent them from taking any chances and deter them from reoffending because they are being so closely watched.

In conclusion, having training in prison and also close observation when first time offenders are released are effective in dealing with the issue. If governments implemented these solutions, crime figures would soon drop.
