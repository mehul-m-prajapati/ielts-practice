#### The growing number of overweight people is putting strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved. Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?

Owing to the problems which a growing population of overweight people cause for the health care system, some people think that the key to solving these issues is to have more sport and exercise in schools.
I completely agree that this is the best way to tackle the issue of deteriorating public health in relation to weight.

**Firstly**, dealing with the issues surrounding obesity and weight problems is best solved by taking a long term approach and introducting more sport and exercise in schools. 
This method will ensure that the next generation will be healthier and will not have such health problems. 
**At the moment**, the average child in the West does sport possibly twice a week, which is not enough to counteract their otherwise sedentary lifestyle.
**However**, by incorporating more sports classes into the curriculum as well as encouraging extracurricular sports activities, they will undoubtebly become fitter and and more active.

**Another point to consider** is that having more sports lessons for children in schools will probably result in children developing an interest in exercise which might filter through
to other members of their family and have a longer lasting effect. **In other words**, parents with sporty children are more likely to get involved in sport as a way of encouraging their children.
By both parents and children being involved, it will ensure that children grow up to incorporate sport into their daily lives. 
This is certainly a natural and lasting way to improve public health.

**In conclusion**, to deal with an increasing population of unfit, overweight people, changing the lifestyle of the coming generation by introducing sport in schools is the easiest and most effective method to use.

#### The development of tourism contributed to English becoming the most prominent language in the world. Some people think that this will lead to English becoming the only language to be spoken globally. What are the advantages and disadvantages to having one language in the world?

**It is thought by some people that English**, which is now the most widely spoken language in the world, may one day predominate over all other languages and result in their
eventual disappearance. Having one language would certainly aid understanding and economic growth but there will also be some drawbacks.

One evident benefit to having one global language is that it would enable greater understanding between countries. 
**In other words**, if everyone spoke one language, there would be complete understanding between not only countries but all people throughout the world which would promote learning,
the flow of information and ideas. **Another reason** that one language would be advantageous is that it would help economic growth. With all people speaking the same language, there would be fewer barriers and therefore trade would flourish between countries, resulting in a healthier world economy.

**On the other hand**, ther are obvious disadvantages to having only one global language. **Firstly,** it would mean that all other languages would eventually disappear and, along with them, their cultures. The diversity of cultures is one of the joys this world has to offer. Each culture is unique with its own way of life and own perspectives of the world which would all be lost if there were only one language. **Secondly**, it would result in the collapse of tourism because there would be no reason to travel for pleasure and interest if all countries had the same language and similar cultures. This would devastate many countries economically that rely on tourism as a source of income.

In conclusion, while there are plus points to having one global language, too much would be lost as a result. Maintaining local languages and cultures should be prioritised 
to ensure a rich world heritage for future genrations.
